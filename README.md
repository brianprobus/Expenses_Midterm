# Expenses_Midterm
Python Midterm to create expense breakdown

In this midterm, you are to create a budget program.  You will have to create a series of three people and give them a salary, 2 expenses, and their left over cash at the end of the week.  You will also be comparing their left over expenses to an amount of money they need to save every week.  You will then display all this information to the user at the end of the program. This will be worth 50 points of the total of 100 points for your Midterm!
Requirements
1.	Create a series three inputs that ask “What is your name?”  This will create a series of three people that you will use in the following problems.
2.	Create three weekly salary variables.  You will need three because you want to match up with the three people. They will all need to be inputs. 
3.	Create at least 4 expenses for the week PER PERSON.  They can be mortgage, groceries, or whatever you wish.  Those values should be inputs, and added together to equal a variable named weekly_expenses (You will need three of these weekly_expenses variables).
4.	Subtract the expenses from the each of the 3 people’s salary.
5.	This will be their left over money at the end of the week.
6.	We want our individuals to save money!  Let’s assume that we want our individuals to have at least 10% of their weekly salary available after expenses!
7.	Create a condition OR a loop that compares the LEFT OVER money after expenses to the 10% we want to save a week.  If the amount left over is less than the amount we need to save then display the message “(Person), needs to save more money.”  Otherwise display a message that says “Congratulations, you are on your way to financial freedom!”
8.	At the end of the program, display each individuals name, their weekly salary, their expenses, their weekly salary after expenses, and the amount of money they need to save.  The message on step 7 can be displayed either before or after this step!
